## Introduction
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm that efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified limit. This program is a C++ implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

## Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
3. Compile the program (See [Compilation](#compilation) for instructions).
4. Run the program with the desired input (see below for command line options).

### Command Line Options
The program accepts one command line argument:
- `Size`: An integer that specifies the upper limit for finding prime numbers.

Example usage:
```bash
./sieve_of_eratosthenes 100
```

This will display the prime numbers up to the specified limit.
This program was developed as part of an academic project for the "Computability and Algorithmics" course at Universidad de La Laguna.
